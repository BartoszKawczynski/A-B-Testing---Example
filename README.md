## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Project of statistical hypotheses test and evaluate the statistical significance of results, create visualizations for A/B tests, summarize and present test results.
Used libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Stats, NumPy.
Function example: stats.ttest_ind(), shape[], sum(), pd.to_datetime(), min().date(), max().date().
Tasks (step by step):
Read data from a file and display information about A/B test results:

     number of users in groups A and B,
     number of conversions in groups A and B,
     conversion rate in groups A and B,
     test start and end date, as well as test duration in days.

Select a statistical criterion for hypothesis testing and calculate the statistic and p-value. See if we can reject the null hypothesis.
Create a visualization to compare mean values for groups with 95% confidence intervals.
